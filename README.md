# COP4710-final-project

In this project, we built an application to manage an online game store. The application allows administrators of the store to view the inventory of games, view orders, view customer accounts, as well as add games to the inventory, create orders, and create customer accounts. This is not a customer-facing app, but rather is only for administrators of the store.
